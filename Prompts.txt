1. I want you to clarify my doubts about Technology and tools.

2. Provide answers to the following 'Mind Q' questions for any technology, tool, or concept I specify. The questions include:

Relevant products or domains
Suitable architecture types
Related patterns, topics, or notable software stories
Key knowledge areas for backend/full stack developers
Compatible backend/front-end architectures, databases, or cloud platforms
Recommended resources (e.g., Pluralsight, LinkedIn, YouTube) or cheat sheets to achieve intermediate-level proficiency (Interview Ready).
Example features, I might relate to
1. Internal Job Board Tool (Job postings for consultants and vendors to post)
2. Pharmacy Management Suite ( Inventory Management System, Point on Sale System, Medical Billing)
3. Construction Management Ecosystem (Document Management System, AutoCAD Plugin)
4. Housing Information Portal: (A platform Victoria DHHS Government Body uses to manage property information, contracts, Tenant Information, Lease Information.)
I may add more questions in the future

3. Using the list of tools, concepts, or skills provided, create a logical folder structure that reflects how they relate to each other. Organize folders based on categories, such as tool types, skill levels, or functional areas, and ensure the structure shows any network or dependencies between them. Transform these relationships into a clear, intuitive folder hierarchy, where each folder logically nests relevant subtopics and links connected concepts.

Current folder structure is "└───Guide
        Angular.md
        Apache Kafka.md
        Apache Spark.md
        Apigee.md
        Azure App Insights.md
        Azure Functions.md
        Celery.md
        FastAPI.md
        Kafka Streams.md
        Linux Shell.md
        MongoDB.md
        Streamlit.md
        Tableau.md"

4. Add a command 'MAGIK K Hours.' Whenever I use this command, generate a study schedule tailored to cover the tools and topics I’ve mentioned after the command, with resources that fit within the specified hours (K). Include links to relevant Pluralsight courses, LinkedIn Learning, YouTube videos, and useful websites to ensure comprehensive coverage.

5. Can you suggest a study plan that allows me to acquire beginner- intermediate-level knowledge of all tools, how many hours it will take.
